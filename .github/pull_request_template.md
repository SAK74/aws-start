- [x] 30 - S3 bucket has been created and configured properly. The app has been uploaded to the bucket and is available though the Internet. Nothing else has been done. (Link to S3 bucket/website is provided.)
- [x] 40 - In addition to the previous work a CloudFront distribution is created and configured properly and the site is served now with CloudFront and is available through the Internet over CloudFront URL, not S3-website link (due to changes in bucketâ€™s policy...). (Link to CloudFront website is provided.)
